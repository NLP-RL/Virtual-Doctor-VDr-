# Virtual Doctor (VDr)

The World Health Organization (WHO, 2016) predicts that there will be more than 14.5 million healthcare workforce shortages by 2030, despite an increase in 40 million health-sector jobs. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has wrecked the headway made towards universal health coverage throughout recent years while highlighting existing imbalances in the health sector inside and between nations (WHS, 2021). With the motivation to assist doctors and early diagnosis, IIT Patna’s researchers and professor are developing an automatic disease diagnosis assistant (diagnosis chatbot) named virtual doctor (V Dr.) that conducts a thorough symptom investigation and prepares a diagnosis report for doctors. The assistant acts as a junior doctor that assists a clinician in disease diagnosis task. Additionally, it can serve as the first point of contact in remote areas where doctors are hard to reach. Abhisek Tiwari, a research scholar, has received the highly regarded Prime Minister Research Fellowship (PMRF) for the project by MHRD, Government of India.  The project is mentored by Abhisek’s Ph.D. supervisor, Dr. Sriparna Saha (Associate Professor, IIT Patna), and Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya (Professor, IIT Bombay). In addition, the project is being supervised and mentored by Dr. Minakshi Dhar (Senior Doctor at AIIMS Rishikesh). Dr. Dhar provides the guidelines for the expected behavior of the AI-based junior doctor and continuously examines the ongoing progress. The researchers and doctors have been working on the project since last year, and they are expecting it to be ready for final screening and deployment by 2024.
